Hotel Records aims to make managing hotel data easier than ever! Insert some data about a hotels' customers and watch the site calculate whether a gift should be given to customers based on their history to possibly boost sales. You can see your recents searches and insertions on the home page. The site uses a login system similar to that found in CS50 Finance. You can search for customers meeting specific criteria using the basic or advanced search functions. For the advanced search, you can mix and match criteria, similar to filtering products on an e-commerce website. The reset button erases all existing data and loads dummy data to demonstrate the program's functionality. Thanks for visiting!
