# Hotel Records

Welcome to Hotel Records, an intuitive web application designed to revolutionize the management of hotel customer data. This project, my first ever, aims to simplify data entry, retrieval, and analysis of hotel customers to enhance customer relations and boost sales through targeted rewards. This was my final project as part of the CS50 course.

## Features

- **Customer Data Management**: Easily insert and manage data about hotel customers.
- **Reward System**: Automatically calculates whether a gift should be given to customers based on their visitation history, potentially increasing customer loyalty and sales.
- **User Dashboard**: View recent searches and data insertions directly on the home page.
- **Advanced Search Options**: Utilize both basic and advanced search functions to filter through customer data effectively, similar to e-commerce product filters.
- **Demo Data Reset**: A reset functionality that erases all existing data and loads dummy data to demonstrate the program's capabilities.
- **Secure Login System**: Incorporates a robust login system inspired by CS50's Finance course, ensuring data security and user authentication.
